1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,960
If you store any personal information on a
computer, smartphone, or web service,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,220
your data is at risk from two massive computer
security exploits: Spectre and Meltdown.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,039
Two major flaws in computer chips, called "Meltdown" and "Spectre."

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,039
Technology firms are rushing to fix a security flaw identified in computer chips.

5
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,059
What makes Meltdown and 
Spectre especially sinister, aside from their

6
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,000
James Bondian names,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,780
is that they affect your
computer at the hardware level:

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,759
the processors inside your devices.

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,420
And these flaws exist not because of a bug in
computer software design, but because of

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:51,520
a feature in computer hardware that has been
around since 1995.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
Consumers expect computers to get faster and
faster each year.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,679
The new Apple TV isn't just slightly faster,

13
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,159
it's remarkably faster.

14
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,719
We built the fastest, most responsive stylus experience ever.

15
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,400
To satisfy this insatiable need for increasingly
fast computers, chip developers added a function

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,239
to processors called Speculative Execution.

17
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,049
Processors are the chips inside a computer

18
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,040
that allow it to perform hundreds of billions
of calculations per second.

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,879
Think of it as the computer’s brain.

20
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,400
Speculative execution allows the computer
to guess what you might do next and perform

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:36,319
necessary calculations for those possible
outcomes, keeping one step ahead of you.

22
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,890
Imagine if your favorite coffee shop began
preparing your favorite orders ahead of time.

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,590
Your coffee is ready for you before you ask
for it and you’re in and out of the shop

24
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,530
faster than if you were to order from scratch
every time.

25
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,280
That’s speculative execution.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,280
But what about the orders that were made that
you didn’t purchase?

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,599
Or what if you decide to order something else
entirely that day?

28
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,519
Those unused, pre-made orders...well, they
get trashed.

29
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,450
That’s the problem with speculative execution
— all those junked orders,

30
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,289
They’re not really protected.

31
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:10,259
Someone sorting through those trashed orders
might gain brief unauthorized access to your

32
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,039
name or your daily order.

33
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,530
But, of course, the information you keep on
your computer is probably a bit more sensitive

34
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,889
than your preference for almond milk.

35
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:27,530
Meltdown and Spectre exploit this feature
by using malicious code that tricks a computer

36
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,319
into speculatively loading information it
wouldn’t normally have access to.

37
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,879
And you — or an antivirus program — wouldn’t
necessarily know that someone is snooping

38
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,800
on your data since Meltdown and Spectre are
exploiting a normal function of your computer’s processor.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,719
These exploits could allow a hacker to snoop
on data on a computer or a smartphone, or even in the cloud.

40
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,729
Spectre allows a malicious program or code
to trick other applications, using a shared

41
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:59,939
processor, into loading sensitive information
that it would normally keep secure and separate

42
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:01,810
between the programs.

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,759
Meltdown works slightly differently — instead
of tricking one application into revealing

44
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,680
sensitive information to another, it exploits
the relationship between the application and

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,919
the computer’s memory — but in the end,
the results are the same: compromised data

46
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,560
While Software companies are rolling out patches
to help guard against Meltdown, that protection

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,520
comes at a cost.

48
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,360
And in some cases, those patches could make
a computer operate slower.

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,520
Though software patches can prevent some Spectre
attacks, it really requires new hardware to

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,199
be designed and implemented to completely
fix the problem.

51
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,879
And that means many devices could be vulnerable
to Spectre attacks for decades,

52
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,960
as devices are upgraded.

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,759
But don’t let that stop you from installing
patches and protecting your data now.

54
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,879
Seriously, that would not be smart.

55
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,158
It was our need for speed that got us into

56
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:52,520
this mess in the first place..

57
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,380
And good security nearly always comes with a compromise
